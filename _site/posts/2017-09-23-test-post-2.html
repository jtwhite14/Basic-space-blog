<p>The structure itself was originally built by the owner and his son from a cabin kit purchased from Shelter Institute out of Woolwich, Maine. The location and structure of the cabin proved ideal, but the interior space needed to be reimagined to optimize each square inch while letting the cabin breath. Some existing elements were to be refined while others were altered and eliminated. The inconsistent window dimensions made for uniquely proportioned frames for the surrounding landscape. However, the existing mustard yellow walls and matching stained wood floors mudded up these views. Wrapping the interior surfaces in crisp white materials created a clean, undistracted backdrop for the wildlife to take the stage. The underbelly of the loft was white washed to keep the natural wood grain apparent, but to mute its presence. The hardwood floors were re-stained a warm, dark chocolate to anchor the cabin’s interior. Half of the loft’s floorboards were removed, allowing light from the windows above to filter down and expand the vertical space.</p>
