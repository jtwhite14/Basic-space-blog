Our Beach Street Carriage House project was a fun one. At first glance, it's hard to see a welcoming, bright, clean space, but you can only go up from these "before" photos.

Tucked away from the street and looking down on a marsh, this is the ideal New England getaway location. Previously owned by one of Ford Model's owners, this 70's excentric decor was dated. Luckily, the purchase of the house was a good deal so we could invest in timeless upgrades. 

Purchased as a rental property  for additional income, this was our first project where our client was not the person who would occupy the space. Our goal was not to craft a house that worked for a specific family, but to renovate it to operate for *any* family. We went back to basic, creating a beautiful backdrop where someone could grow into it and make it there own. Clean lines, a bright palette, and modern materials and appliances were integrated. The house went through extensive structural changes to as staircases were relocated, dormer's added for additional headroom upstairs, plumbing relocated.

Because we didn't know the family who would occupy this space, we photographed it without the elements of a specific dweller. Our fear of the house feeling empty and vacant was soon diminished as we felt welcomed by the big open bedrooms, and inspired by the spacious kitchen countertops.
