Nurseries are some of my favorite spaces to be a part of. They represent love, family, new life, and miracles, all while fostering first memories. 
 
However, when we design a nursery, our client or “end user” is someone who isn’t in this world yet, has not formed a personality and style preferences, and whose sex may not even be revealed. A tricky task! This means we design for the parents’ expectations of what is to come. Excitement driven by paternal instincts and the basic necessities of parenthood and infantry.
 
Converting a guest bedroom or office into a nursery is a common transformation for new families. Designing a nursery in less than 100 square feet is common in New York City apartments. Even more, this 2nd bedroom contained a plethora of obstacles: funky nooks and crannies, door swings, radiator, and exposed brick.

In New York City, you have to get crafty! So, we incorporated multi-use furniture pieces. A slim profile daybed coupled as a nursing chair, extra lounge seating for reading books, and a guest bed. The dresser was topped with a changing table, and book ledges were installed to utilize the rooms ceiling height. 
 
We kept the pallet neutral and worked with the existing antique chandelier, exposed brick wall, and grey wall color. A calming, quaint, sophisticated space was created for these parent’s first baby - a girl! - and their family and friends. Based on her laughs and curious vigor during our photoshoot, I think baby Kallie approves!
