Nurseries are some of my favorite spaces to be a part of. They represent love, family, new life, miracles all while fostering first memories. 
 
As a designer, you are essentially designing for someone who isn’t in this world yet, has not formed a personality and preferences, and who’s sex may not even be revealed. A tricky task! This means we design for the parents’ ideas of what is to come: excitement that is driven by paternal instincts and the basics necessities of parenthood and infantry.
 
Converting a guest bedroom or office into a nursery is a common transformation. Design a nursery in less than 100 square feet, common in New York apartments.
 
To our surprise, this bedroom contained even more that just a small footprint to work around: funky nooks and crannies, door swings, radiator, and exposed brick.

In New York you have to get crafty! So, we incorporated multi-use furniture pieces. A slim profile daybed coupled as a nursing chair, extra lounge seating for reading books, and a guest bed. The dresser was topped with a changing table and book ledges were installed to utilize the rooms ceiling height. 
 
We kept the pallet neutral and worked with the existing antique chandelier, exposed brick wall, and grey paint color. A calming, quaint, sophisticated space was created for these parent’s first baby - a girl! - and their family and friends. Based on her laughs and curious vigor during our photoshoot, I think baby Kallie approves!
