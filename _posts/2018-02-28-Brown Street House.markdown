One of our first projects, Brown Street House is located in the historical district of Cambridge, Massachusetts. This family needed a few elements spruced up! The two areas that we focused on were where the parents spent most of their time - the kitchen and master suite. Along with a fresh coat of yellow paint, the focus point of this kitchen was given a facelift. The built-in pantry that was once concealing all of their beautiful dish-ware was reinvented. The top doors were taken off completely and the whole unit painted with oil paint - a shout out to it's early 1900's origin. To show off their white ceramic dishes, crystal stemware, and colored Japanese rice bowls, the back wall was painted a stoic deep gray.

This was back when I was starting my portfolio and would do anything to gain experience so I painted the cabinets, reinstalled the bottom doors, and also re-painted the master bedrooms. Don't worry, I hired a high-schooler to take off the old, melded-on wallpaper! Just a word for the wise, oil-based paint is not easy to work with. It is very thick, smelly, and takes a full week to completely dry. However, it's output is unparalleled.
