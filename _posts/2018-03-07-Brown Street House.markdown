One of our first projects, Brown Street House is located in the historical district of Cambridge, Massachusetts. This family needed a few elements spruced up! The two areas that we focused on were where the parents spent most of their time - the kitchen and master suite. Along with a fresh coat of yellow paint, the focus point of this kitchen was given a facelift. The built-in pantry that was once concealing all of their beautiful dish-ware was reinvented. The top doors were taken off completely and the whole unit painted with oil paint - a shout out to it's early 1900's origin. To show off their white ceramic dishes, crystal stemware, and colored Japanese rice bowls, the back wall was painted a stoic deep gray.

Let's start with the obvious in the master bedroom - that wallpaper. Some of it was pealing, other areas stained from water damage. With old houses, come old finishes! We hinted towards Japanese influences with natural materials and color palettes. We reorganized the furniture to better suite their needs. Once we were done, the bedroom had morphed from an ugly duckling to a calming oasis.

This was back when I was starting my portfolio and would do anything to gain experience so I painted the cabinets, reinstalled the bottom doors, and also re-painted the master bedrooms. Don't worry, I hired a high-schooler to take off the old, melded-on wallpaper! Just a word for the wise, oil-based paint is not easy to work with. It is very thick, smelly, and takes a full week to completely dry. However, it's output is unparalleled.
