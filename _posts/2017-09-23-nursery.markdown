Nurseries are some of my favorite spaces to be a part of! These areas represent love, family, new life, memories, and the list goes on. What I find interesting is designing for someone who isn’t in this world yet, at least not completely, and who also doesn’t have a style/personality or aesthetic taste. This means the parents play a bit role in these decisions most of which I find are driven by paternal instincts and the basics necessities of parenthood and infantry. 

Converting a guest bedroom or office into the nursery is a common transformation when preparing for your first child - this Harem, NY family came to me to accomplish just that. Their space however was quite small, tight and had some weird shapes that restricted its use. Non-conventional projects are always my favorite so we got to work.

The obvious needs were to fit the basics - crib, dresser, toys, books, diaper genie, etc but instead of a nursing rocker that could only be used for one purpose, they wanted this nursery to also be space for their loved ones to visit and be a part of their newborn’s life. A narrow daybed that could also act as a comfortable seat for nursing and reading books by adding a few large pillows was just the perfect solution. A few existing elements were incorporated in the design like the brick wall, the antique chandelier and the neutral grey walls. A sophisticated, calming yet youthful color scheme was chosen to cater the multi-use functions of the room. I think baby Kallie approves based on her laughs, smiles and curious vigor during our photoshoot. :)
