Basicspace officially turned 2 this July and we are celebrating by looking back on our first project and giving you some before and afters!

Located in a costal community town, and tucked away from Jerusalem Road into preservation land, is this sweet little cabin perfectly set up for a work/live retreat. With miles of walking paths surrounding the property, the goal for this renovation was to engage with nature even when inside. The wood tones were darkened on the floor and whitewashed on the ceiling to ground the interior. The mustard yellow was brightened to white and the loft above was opened up. The new space allowed natural light to filter through and 360 views whether the use is writing a novel or day dreaming.

The small square footage was also defined by furniture and the program separated by levels.
